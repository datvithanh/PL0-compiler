Have the folder compiler on your desktop with data.h, main.c, lex.c, parser.c, vm.c, and all test input files in it.

Open Terminal and do this:

cd Desktop
cd compiler
cc - o compile main.c lex.c parser.c vm.c
./compile (for running through whole program using test files)
./compile -l -a -v (for running through whole program with flags printed to terminal)
